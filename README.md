## Process
Initially, I spent some time studying the GitHub API documentation and clarifying the requirements.<br>
I used Postman and the website to confirm the data and parameters. At first,<br>
I tried using third-party libraries to retrieve GitHub API data, but was unsuccessful.<br>
Later, I started a new project and used the native method to access network data.<br>
This took a lot of time, around 8 hours. In this project, I tried adding the Observerable method to MVVM,<br>
which resulted in unexpected type errors, but I was able to resolve them all eventually<br>

Time spent:<br> 
  UI: Within 2 hours<br>
  Observerable: Over 12 hours<br>
  GitHub API documentation research: Over 1 hour<br>
  Network data processing: Over 8 hours<br>

In this exercise, I tried and learned:

Personal data URLs can be linked
Adding Observerable to MVVM, which was my first time using this method.
Reading the GitHub API documentation
Rest API - Retrieving data from servers.
