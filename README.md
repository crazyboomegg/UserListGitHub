# UserListGitHub

Initially, I spent some time studying the GitHub API documentation and clarifying the requirements. 
I used Postman and the website to confirm the data and parameters. At first, 
I tried using third-party libraries to retrieve GitHub API data, but was unsuccessful. 
Later, I started a new project and used the native method to access network data. 
This took a lot of time, around 8 hours. In this project, I tried adding the Observerable method to MVVM, 
which resulted in unexpected type errors, but I was able to resolve them all eventually.

Time spent:
UI: Within 2 hours
Observerable: Over 12 hours
GitHub API documentation research: Over 1 hour
Network data processing: Over 8 hours

In this exercise, I tried and learned:

Personal data URLs can be linked
Adding Observerable to MVVM, which was my first time using this method.
Reading the GitHub API documentation
Rest API - Retrieving data from servers.
