## Process
Initially, I spent some time studying the GitHub API documentation and clarifying requirements.<br> 
I used Postman and the web to confirm data and parameters,<br>  
and attempted to obtain GitHub API data using a third-party library, but was unable to succeed.<br> 
I then started a new project and used the native method for accessing network layer data,<br> 
which took a lot of time in processing network data. In total, I spent around 8 hours.<br> 
In this project, I also attempted to install third-party libraries using Xcode SPM.<br> 
I tried to use the Observerable method in MVVM, but encountered many unexpected type errors,<br> 
which were eventually resolved one by one.

## Time spent:<br> 
  * UI: Within 2 hours<br>
  * Observerable: Over 12 hours<br>
  * GitHub API documentation research: Over 1 hour<br>
  * Network data processing: Over 8 hours<br>

## n this exercise, I tried and learned:<br>

* Personal data URLs can be linked<br>
* Adding Observerable to MVVM, which was my first time using this method.<br>
* Reading the GitHub API documentation<br>
* Rest API - Retrieving data from servers.
